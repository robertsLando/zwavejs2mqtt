# Usage statistics

In order to gain insight into how `zwave-js` is used, which manufacturers and devices are most prevalent and where to best focus our efforts in order to improve `zwave-js` the most, we collect statistics about the devices used in our ecosystem. This information is only collected **if you opt in** into this functionality, the opt-in popup dialog is automatically shown the first time you open the UI.

Since some users may have concerns about this data being collected, even though the data cannot be tied to a specific user, we have built our own [statistics stack](https://github.com/zwave-js/statistics-server) which is self-hosted next to the Sentry instances. For more informations check [here](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/data-collection/data-collection?id=usage-statistics).
