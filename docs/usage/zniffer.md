# Zniffer

A Zniffer is a Z-Wave controller with special firmware that can capture Z-Wave traffic from any nearby Z-Wave device. This is useful for troubleshooting, as it allows you to see exactly what is being sent and received by the devices in your network.

Follow [this](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/troubleshooting/zniffer) guide in order to create your own Zniffer hardware.

## How to use Zniffer

You can use Zniffer in parallel with your Z-Wave network, so you can capture traffic without interrupting your network. In order to use it just configure Zniffer related settings in `Settings > Zniffer` section.

Once you have enabled and configured Zniffer settings, a new entry will show at the bottom of left side nav, open that page and start capturing traffic from the Web UI ðŸ˜Ž.
