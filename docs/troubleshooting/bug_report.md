# Bug Report

When something isn't working as expected you should [open an issue](https://github.com/zwave-js/zwavejs2mqtt/issues/new/choose) on Github. To help us debugging your issue you should provide some additional informations like logs and node export if needed.

## Export Logs

The are two main loggers, one for zwavejs2mqtt and one for zwave-js module.

To help us finding what's going on, when reporting a bug, you should attach the logs coming from both loggers.

Both loggers options are configurable from the UI in `Settings`:

1. The ZwaveJS logger can be confgured in `Zwave` section, enable `Log enabled` switch and `Log To File` and set `Log Level` to `silly`
2. The zwavejs2mqtt logger can be confgured in `General` section, enable `Log enabled` switch and `Log To File` and set `Log Level` to `silly`

Now press on `SAVE` button to store the new settings and your logs will be stored in separeted files inside `store` folder. The zwavejs2mqtt log output file will be named `zwavejs2mqtt.log` and the zwavejs one `zwavejs_<processid>.log`

You can easily download a zip with this logs files from the `Explorer` view on the UI. Just select the files you want to export, press on the fab button on the bottom right corner and press the download icon. Remember to attach the zip to your issue.
